              <li>Both sheet and grain absorbent can absorb all acid and solvent also absorbent sheet have reaction with nitric acid as color of absorbent (yellow to none). However, grain absorbent has especially reaction with sulfuric acid 98% (white to black). Finally, both sheet and grain have reaction with Nitric acid 97% as less fuming.
                After that 10 days, I found ability of absorb solvent of both grain and sheet that had very liked. However, result of absorb with acid had difference, especial both hydrochloric and sulfuric acid that effect to grain absorbent.
                Sheet absorbent is suitable than grain absorbent because result of experiment illuminated the resistance of sheet absorbent is better than grain absorbent.</li>
